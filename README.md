A [Flarum](http://flarum.org)  extension. Make the [Blog]([http://flarum.org](https://github.com/v17development/flarum-blog)) sidebar section sticky and scrollable.

## Motivation

Usually when we make the sidenav section sticky, we have to scroll to the bottom of the page to view the tags that are not shown in the first place. This extension resolves the problem by making the sidenav scrollable, which can be useful when using the [AutoMore](https://github.com/noriods/automore) extension.

## Scrollbar

The scrollbar will appear only if there are too many tags AND the mouse is hovering above the sidenav. Example:
